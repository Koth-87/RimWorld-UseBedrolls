	<description>Bedrolls are used from the inventory. When a pawn needs to rest but can't find a bed, he'll place a bedroll from his inventory.

Bedrolls are picked back up after sleeping.

Bedrolls are shared amongst members of a caravan: they will all have one so you don't need to find a bedroll from someone else.

(This all technically applies to any type of bed, if you can get a pawn to hold it.)

Bedrolls can be created at tailoring benches (in minified form instead of a constructed building)
